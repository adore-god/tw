    <h1 class="bold800">The Bible's Revelation through Neville Goddard</h1>
    
<h2 class="center normal-headings bold700">Of God,<br> Man, Woman,<br> Love & Sin. <br> Set in the <br> kingdom of the mind.</h2>
<h3 class="bold600 normal-headings" style="font-size:1.1em;">The structure of fulfilment within Scripture.</h3> 
    <p class="lead">
      God, the Lord, and the forces of the mind—<a href="https://god.thway.uk/exodus-314-i-am.html">judges</a>, kings, and rulers—are revealed in a story of imagination, love, and the unfolding of consciousness. 
      This is the greatest love story ever told: the <a class="foundational-verse b7"  href="https://god.thway.uk/el/bible-kingdom-structure.html">kingdom within you</a>, guided by faith, delight, and assumption.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The Bible's narrative is presented within the structure of a kingdom, with the Lord presiding as the ruler within you, and judges, kings, and rulers guiding the affairs of your mind. 
      Through its narrative, over 3,000 years ago, natural landmarks, events, and human characters were used to show how the kingdom of the inner mind functions. 
      Neville Goddard revealed that human imagination is God, acting through the <a href="https://god.thway.uk/exodus-314-i-am.html">judges and rulers of your mind</a> to shape reality, and reveals how to govern it through 
      <a class="foundational-verse b7" href="https://god.thway.uk/jesus-paradise-pleasure-and-abundance.html">delight, faith, and love</a>.
      </p>
 
    <p>
      Whatever you cleave to and dwell upon in your mind, the Bible declares, will come to pass as experience in your outer world. 
      </p>
 
    <p>
      This kingdom unfolds from a few 
      <a class="foundational-verse b7" href="https://god.thway.uk/genesis-foundational-principles.html">foundational verses in Genesis</a>, 
      and Neville Goddard shows that the Bible is the law of assumption, guiding you in how to 
      <a class="foundational-verse b7" href="https://god.thway.uk/ask-believe-receive-catalyst-for-love.html">'ask, believe, receive'</a> in the governance of your own inner kingdom.
    </p>
    <p> 
This site presents a self-empowered, non-theological approach that moves beyond traditional religious interpretation.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Throughout history, all spiritual systems, tarot, metaphysics, and archetypes, draw inspiration from the Bible and echo its revelation of imagination as God.

    <h2>New Bible Interpretation Key</h2> 
    <div id="Verse-Link-Container"><img class="key-icon" alt="Bible Interpreter Key Icon" src="https://god.thway.uk/images/icons/verse-link-icon.png"><div id="VerseLinkBox"><p><a class="release" href="https://god.thway.uk/el/yhvh-ehyeh-linguistic-framework.html">NEW BIBLE PASSAGE AND VERSE TRANSLATOR</a>.</p></div></div>
    <p> 
    This site introduces a <a href="https://god.thway.uk/el/yhvh-ehyeh-linguistic-framework.html">Bible Interpretation Key</a> — a linguistic, pattern-based framework rooted in Genesis that reveals how Scripture’s foundational structures repeat from beginning to end. </p><p>At its core is a threefold pattern within the Bible’s most fundamental terms: YHVH/LORD (present consciousness), Ehyeh/I AM (assumed identity), and Elohim (the governing structure or judges of identity) — a trinity of roles that unfold through every narrative and name in Scripture. Inspired by Neville Goddard’s teaching that the Bible is a scientific book, a precise, patterned text of imagination and identity, <a href="https://god.thway.uk/el/yhvh-ehyeh-linguistic-framework.html">this key treats Scripture as an internally consistent system</a>. </p><p>Rather than reading the Bible as disconnected history, it offers a repeatable method for interpreting any passage through the same linguistic and psychological design that governs the whole.
